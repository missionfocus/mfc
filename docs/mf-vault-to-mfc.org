#+TITLE: Migrating from mf-vault to mfc

1. If you installed mf-vault manually, delete the binary, e.g: ~rm
   /usr/local/bin/mf-vault~. If you installed mf-vault using Homebrew:

   1. Uninstall the mf-vault formula: ~brew uninstall mf-vault~
   2. Remove the tap: ~brew untap mf-open-source/mf-vault~

2. Install mfc from the [[https://git.missionfocus.com/ours/code/tools/mfc/-/releases][GitLab Releases page]]:

   1. Select the correct binary for your platform
   2. Copy it into your preferred location on your PATH, e.g.
      ~/usr/local/bin/mfc~
   3. Add execute permissions: ~chmod +x /usr/local/bin/mfc~
   4. Confirm the install was successful by opening a new terminal session and
      running ~mfc --version~. You should see something like "mfc version v2.0.0"

3. In the future, update mfc using ~mfc update~
